# Digispark PPM-to-USBJoystick 

Use a digispark or similar (any attiny85) as an PPM-to-USBJoystick adapter using any ppm source.

There are some simulator cables out there that you can buy from nearly any shop which names 
are well known. But as the name tells everything: cable. 
Get rid of the cable! Okay, you probably want to get rid of it and now you can! 
I'm using a "MCS digistump digispark" (lsusb) and the corresponding arduino library and also
a Flysky FS-A8S with my FS-i6x. As this project uses the ppm protocol, any ppm receiver should 
work out of the box. Even any transmitter with ppm output should work.
